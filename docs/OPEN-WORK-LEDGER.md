# Open-Work Ledger

Single source of open work for this fork (tracked + untracked). Newest/most-active on top.
🔴 = untracked (MD-only, no GitHub issue). Read this at session start — see the memory
protocol in `docs/agents/` and the entry map (`using-t4`).

> This is a **fork** of [BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)
> (unmaintained upstream). Fork-specific changes live in `CHANGES-FORK.md`. This ledger tracks
> the fork's own open work, not upstream's.

## Active

- 🔴 **Cross-platform CLI discovery** — `clink/discovery.py` known-install-locations are
  Windows-focused (winget / `%LOCALAPPDATA%` / npm). macOS/Linux paths not yet added; on those
  OSes it degrades to PATH-only. Add per-OS candidates when the fork runs there.
- 🔴 **Antigravity live model-selection integration test** — unit tests assert the `_build_command`
  ordering (`tests/test_clink_model_effort.py::test_antigravity_places_model_before_print`), but
  there's no opt-in live test that drives `agy` and asserts the selected model reaches the backend.
  See `docs/reports/2026-07-16-clink-antigravity-model-override-investigation.md` (acceptance criteria).
- 🔴 **Config activation persistence, revisited** — zero-setup discovery + the bundled active
  `claude-9arm.json` cover the common case; the `~/.pal/cli_clients/` user-dir override is the
  escape hatch for custom gateways/paths. No open code item; documented in `CHANGES-FORK.md`.
