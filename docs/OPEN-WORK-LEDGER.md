# Open-Work Ledger

Single source of open work for this fork (tracked + untracked). Newest/most-active on top.
🔴 = untracked (MD-only, no GitHub issue). Read this at session start — see the memory
protocol in `docs/agents/` and the entry map (`using-t4`).

> This is a **fork** of [BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)
> (unmaintained upstream). Fork-specific changes live in `CHANGES-FORK.md`. This ledger tracks
> the fork's own open work, not upstream's.

## Active

### Hardening follow-ups (from the 2026-07-16 architecture review, 7.5/10)

Source: `docs/reports/2026-07-16-pal-clink-architecture-hardening-review.md`. The model-routing fix
is sound; these are safety/reliability items for unattended, repo-mutating delegation.

- 🔴 **`readOnlyHint` is inaccurate.** `CLinkTool.get_annotations()` returns `readOnlyHint: True`
  (`tools/clink.py`), but clink launches agents with bypass-approvals/sandbox flags that mutate the
  repo. Fix the annotation to match agentic behavior.
- 🔴 **Workspace/session isolation** — delegated agents run against the live working dir; add
  isolation (a scratch/worktree or explicit cwd) before trusting unattended repo-mutating runs.
- 🔴 **PTY timeout may not interrupt a blocking read** (`clink/agents/antigravity.py` `_run_in_pty`) —
  the timeout check sits between reads; a read that blocks past the deadline isn't interrupted. Harden
  the teardown.
- 🔴 **Test coverage of failure paths** — good command-construction tests exist; the non-zero-exit /
  timeout / parse-error paths (esp. the Antigravity runner) are uncovered.

### Other

- 🔴 **Cross-platform CLI discovery** — `clink/discovery.py` known-install-locations are
  Windows-focused (winget / `%LOCALAPPDATA%` / npm). macOS/Linux paths not yet added; on those
  OSes it degrades to PATH-only. Add per-OS candidates when the fork runs there.
- 🔴 **Antigravity live model-selection integration test** — unit tests assert the `_build_command`
  ordering (`tests/test_clink_model_effort.py::test_antigravity_places_model_before_print`), but
  there's no opt-in live test that drives `agy` and asserts the selected model reaches the backend.
  See `docs/reports/2026-07-16-clink-antigravity-model-override-investigation.md` (acceptance criteria).
- 🔴 **Config activation persistence, revisited** — zero-setup discovery + the bundled active
  `claude-9arm.json` cover the common case; the `~/.pal/cli_clients/` user-dir override is the
  escape hatch for custom gateways/paths. No open code item; documented in `CHANGES-FORK.md`.
