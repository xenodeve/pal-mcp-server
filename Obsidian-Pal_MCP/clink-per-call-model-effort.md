This fork adds optional per-call `model` + `reasoning_effort` params to the `clink` tool (both
optional, appended after config args → backward compatible), via a `_model_args()` hook on the base
agent that `CodexAgent` overrides. Support differs by back-end (all live-verified 2026-07-16):

- **codex** — `model` → `-m` (validated: an invalid model errors 400, not a silent fallback);
  `reasoning_effort` → `-c model_reasoning_effort=<low|medium|high|xhigh|max>` (reasoning tokens
  scale with it). Full support. Account exposes `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`.
- **antigravity** — `model` → `--model` (fail-closed; but the flag must precede `--print` — see
  [[agy-print-swallows-model]]); effort is baked into the model *label* (`(High)`, `(Thinking)`),
  so `reasoning_effort` is ignored.
- **claude-9arm** (Claude Code → a gateway model) — `model` → `--model` (last-wins), limited to what
  the gateway serves; `reasoning_effort` is a no-op (Qwen gateway has only thinking on/off).
- **claude / gemini** — base `--model`; effort ignored.

**How to apply:** dial codex effort up for the hardest leaf / down for cheap mechanical work; for
antigravity, pick effort via the model label; don't expect graded effort on claude/gateway. See
`docs/reports/2026-07-16-model-effort-capability-matrix.md`. Related:
