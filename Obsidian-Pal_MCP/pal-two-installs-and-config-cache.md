On this machine there is **more than one PAL install**, and they don't share code:

- **Claude Code's PAL** runs from a **`uv tool install`** (`~/AppData/Roaming/uv/tools/pal-mcp-server/`).
- **Codex's PAL** runs from **`uvx --from git+…`** (per `~/.codex/config.toml`) — a separate cached env.
- A third source-tree clone (`~/pal-mcp-server/.pal_venv`) may also exist.

Consequences learned the hard way:

- **Config is cached at process start.** Editing a `conf/cli_clients/*.json` needs a full PAL
  **restart** (kill the process + reconnect / restart the editor) — a `/mcp` *reconnect* alone
  attaches to the still-running old process.
- **A `uv tool install --force` / uvx refresh wipes the site-packages `conf/` and code** back to the
  fetched commit — any manual edit there is lost. Put machine-specific configs in `~/.pal/cli_clients/`
  instead (read last, survives reinstalls, **shared by all installs** → one activation covers both
  Claude Code's and Codex's PAL). See [[clink-zero-setup-discovery]].
- On Windows a running PAL **locks** its install dir → kill the PAL process before reinstalling.
- `uv cache clean pal-mcp-server` has hung repeatedly here; copying updated files straight into the
  install (then restart) is a reliable fallback.

**How to apply:** to ship a code/config change to the *running* PAL, update the right install (or all
of them), restart PAL, and verify with a real `clink` call — don't assume a push or a reconnect took.
